## Running the Go code

```
$ go run day<NUM>.go
```

## Building the Rust code

```
$ cargo build
```

And then the binary will be runnable in ``target/debug/<BINARY_NAME>``.

```
$ target/debug/<BINARY_NAME>
```

Alternatively you can run

```
$ cargo run
```

and this will compile the code if needed and then run the binary.
